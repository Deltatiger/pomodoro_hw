This is a simple project to setup a sort of a Pomodoro timer based on a couple of 7 Segment Displays and Raspberry Pi Pico.

TODO:
* Sort of a configuration mode so that the timings can be changed.
* Need some sort of count tracking.
* Add negative scoring
* Move the LED configuration out of the Network Manager

New Idea:
1. Make this a client.
2. Add a simple web app / some GUI app as the Server.
3. Track and monitor everything from the Server App.
